                  <p> I was born in Riga, in 1990, and all my life I live here and don’t have any palns for changing living place.
                      In my early 30th years, I decided to change not only job, but profession, because my previous job didn’t gave me any satisfaction.
                      Why I choose exactly WEB-development? I just saw on YouTube some video about how WEB-page was made, and I really liked the idea, that basically,
                      you made something using only words and numbers, and I liked this idea and I want to move in that direction,
                      of course, after i started WEB-development course I realised, that there is many others thing which you need to learn and which are very dificult for me, but that okay.
                      What else I can say, according to the horoscope I’m Aquarius, I don’t know if this information will have some meaning here. 
                      What else, my mom said, that I’m most beautiful boy in the world, but I have brother who is married, so obviously she lied to one of us, and i know for sure, it was me.

                  <h4>Reading</h4>
                  <p>I like reading, but unfortunately right now I don’t have much time
                    to read. I didn’t like to read in childhood not even in the
                    school, and I’m really regret it right now, because reading opens many doors in the beautiful place. I don’t have any
                    literary genre which I prefer. I can read everything what I think will be interesting, one of my loved books is Fyodor Dostoevsky "Crime and Punishment".

                  <h4>Hiking</h4>
                  <p>I find out about hiking 2 years ago when pandemic started, because it was only
                    way to do something interesting while you are on vacation and you can’t go nowhere.
                    And after that it begun to be my hobby. Some of my friends say that I’m idiot, 
                    but I get satisfaction after walking 30 km in winter forest through the swamps,
                    and you get really tired, all your legs are wet, but still you are very happy after this journey.
                  </p>

                <div class="content">
                  <h4>Running</h4>
                  <p>With running I have the same story like with hiking. In pandemic all gyms were closed and I needed some 
                    activity after work, and running was only activity which you could do without any restriction.
                    And after 2 years of training in May 22 I run my first marathon.

                  <h4>Movies</h4>
                  <p>I can’t say that I'm watching all movies which are coming out today, mostly I prefer watching classic movies are movies which
                    recommended my friend, who is really movies fan. The last movies what i watched was Akira Kurosawa movies, “Seven samurai”, “Rashamon”, “Yojimbo”.
                    And i really liked them, even if there wasn't any special effects like in new films, but still it was realy interesting to watch.
